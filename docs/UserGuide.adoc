== Introduction

AlgoBase (AB) is for those who prefer to use a desktop app for managing algorithm problems. AlgoBase can let you establish and modify your own training plan for algorithm problems flexibly and it can save several training plans at the same time on your local storage!  Also, you can use diverse tags and search to manage your questions and training plans conveniently. More importantly, AlgoBase is optimized for those who prefer to work with a Command Line Interface (CLI) while still having the benefits of a Graphical User Interface (GUI). If you can type fast, ALgoBase can get your problem management tasks done faster than traditional GUI apps. Interested? Jump to the Section 2, “Quick Start” to get started. Enjoy! :-))

== Quick Start

.  Ensure you have Java `11` or above installed in your Computer.
.  Download the latest `algobase.jar` link:{repoURL}/releases[here].
.  Copy the file to the folder you want to use as the home folder for your AlgoBase application.
.  Double-click the file to start the app. The GUI should appear in a few seconds.

+
.  Type the command in the command box and press kbd:[Enter] to execute it. +
e.g. typing *`help`* and pressing kbd:[Enter] will list all possible commands in the result window and open the help window.
.  Some example commands you can try:

* *`listprob`* : lists all problems
* **`addprob`**`n/factorial d/define a function factorial that takes in a number and n and returns the factorial of the number t/recursion a/Halim` : adds a problem called 'factorial' tagged with 'recursion' and authored by 'Halim'
* **`editprob`**`1 src/LeetCode` : edits the first problem displayed and sets its source to 'LeetCode'
* **`switchtab`**`tt/display i/2` : switches to tag tab
* **`switchtab`**`tt/display i/3` : switches to plan tab
+
image::UiStartPlan.png[]
+
* **`findplan`**`n/CS2040` : finds plans that with name 'CS2040'
* **`clear`** : resets Algobase
* *`exit`* : exits the app

.  Refer to <<Features>> for details of each command.

[[Features]]
== Features

====
*Command Format*

* Words in `UPPER_CASE` are the parameters to be supplied by the user e.g. in `addprob n/NAME`, `NAME` is a parameter which can be used as `add n/Two Sequences`.
* Items in square brackets are optional e.g `n/NAME [t/TAG]` can be used as `n/factorial t/recursion` or as `n/factorial`.
* Items with `…`​ after them can be used multiple times including zero times e.g. `[t/TAG]...` can be used as `{nbsp}` (i.e. 0 times), `t/recursion`, `t/recursion t/dynamic-programming` etc.
* Parameters can be in any order e.g. if the command specifies `n/NAME a/AUTHOR`, `a/AUTHOR n/NAME` is also acceptable.
====

=== Problems

==== Adding a problem: `addprob`

Generates a new problem. +
Format: `addprob n/NAME [a/AUTHOR] [w/WEBLINK] [d/DESCRIPTION] [diff/DIFFICULTY] [src/SOURCE] [t/TAG]...`

* `DIFFICULTY` should be an integer or decimal in the range of (0, 5] (left open right close range)

[NOTE]
Don't provide extreme values like `5.00000...01` as difficulty as computers can't store decimals exactly and some round-off error is unavoidable.

[TIP]
A problem can have any number of tags (including 0)

Examples:

* `addprob n/Sequences a/Tung Kam Chuen w/https://open.kattis.com/problems/sequences d/Find the sum of the number of inversions of the 2k sequences, modulo 1000000007 (109+7). diff/3.0 src/Kattis t/recursion`

==== Deleting a problem : `deleteprob`

Deletes an existing problem. +
Format: `deleteprob INDEX [f/]`

* Deletes the problem at the specified `INDEX`.
* The index refers to the index number shown in the displayed problem list.
* The index *must be a positive integer* 1, 2, 3, ...
* The command will fail if the problem identified by `INDEX` is used in some task(s) in existing plans.
Add `f/` to force AlgoBase to delete all tasks associated with the problem.

Examples:

* `listprob` +
`deleteprob 2` +
Deletes the 2nd problem in the displayed list.
* `findprob n/factorial` +
`deleteprob 1` +
Deletes the 1st problem in the results of the `findprob` command.

==== Editing a problem : `editprob`

Edits an existing problem. +
Format: `editprob INDEX [n/NAME] [d/DESCRIPTION] [a/AUTHOR]  [t/TAG]...`

* Edits the problem at the specified `INDEX`. The index refers to the index number shown in the displayed problem list. The index *must be a positive integer* 1, 2, 3, ...
* At least one of the optional fields must be provided.
* Existing values will be updated to the input values.
* When editing tags, the existing tags of the problem will be removed i.e adding of tags is not cumulative.
* You can remove all the problem's tags by typing `t/` without specifying any tags after it.

Examples:

* `editprob 1 a/John Doe` +
Edits the author of the 1st problem to be `John Doe` respectively.
* `editprob 2 n/permutations t/` +
Edits the name of the 2nd problem to be `permutations` and clears all existing tags.

==== Listing all problems : `listprob`

Displays a list of all existing problems. +
Format: `listprob`

// tag::sort[]
==== Sorting problems: `sortprob`

Sorts the current list of results by a specified order and direction. +
Format: `sortprob m/METHOD [ord/ORDER]`

* `METHOD` can be `name`, `author`, `weblink`, `difficulty` or `source`.
* `ORDER` can be `ascend` or `descend` representing ascending and descending order. The default is in ascending order.
* String-based values (i.e. `name`, `author`, etc.) are sorted alphabetically.

[NOTE]
If sorted by ascending order (i.e. the default order), empty fields will have the highest priority, which means if you execute `sortprob m/weblink`, the first few results would be (if any) without web links.

Examples:

* `sortprob m/name`
Sorts the current list of problems in ascending order of names.
* `sortprob m/author ord/descend`
Sorts the current list of problems in descending order of author names.
* `sortprob m/difficulty ord/ascend`
Sorts the current list of problems from lowest to highest difficulty.

// end::sort[]

=== Searching Problems

// tag::find[]
==== Locating problems: `findprob`

Finds problems fulfilling all provided constraints. +
Format: `findprob [n/NAME] [a/AUTHOR] [d/DESCRIPTION] [src/SOURCE] [diff/LOWER_BOUND-UPPER_BOUND] [t/TAG]...`

* Name
** is case-insensitive. e.g. `henz` will match `Henz`
** is considered a match as long as one word matches. (e.g. `Henz Ben` matches both `Martin Henz` and `Ben Leong`)
** is matched word by word. e.g. `hello` will match `hello world` but not `helloworld`
* Author requires an exact match.
* Description
** is case-insensitive
** is matched word by word
** is considered as a match only when the problem's description includes all words in the constraint. e.g. `wordA wordB` matches `wordC wordB wordA` not `wordD wordA`
* Source requires an exact match.
* Tag
** Constraints are separated by spaces. (e.g. `findprob t/Recursion Brute-Force` will display all problems with both tag `Recursion` and `Brute-Force`)
** Constraint tag set is a subset of matching problems. (e.g. `findprob t/Recursion Brute-Force` will match problem with tags `Recursion`+`Brute-Force`+`Playful` but not `Recursion`+`Adhoc`)
** Two tags are considered equal only when their tag strings are exactly matched.
* Difficulty
** matches problems with `LOWER_BOUND \<= difficulty \<= UPPER_BOUND`

[TIP]
If you want to match problems with exact difficulty `1.5`, please use `diff/1.5-1.5`. +
If you want to match problems with with difficulty no lower than `1.5`, please use `diff/1.5-5.0` because `5.0` is the upper limit of difficulty.

[NOTE]
When providing the search restrictions, you should ensure that keywords are non-blank and difficulty range is valid (as specified in `addprob` command). Also at least one search restriction should be provided.

[NOTE]
Words are separated by empty spaces. Thus if we have a sentence "Hello, world!", we have two words `Hello,` and `world!`.

Examples:

* `findprob n/Sequence` +
Returns any problem with word `sequence` (case-insensitive) in its name.
* `findprob t/algorithm diff/2.0-4.0` +
Returns any problem with `algorithm` as one of its tags AND with a difficulty between 2.0 and 4.0 (inclusive).
* `findprob a/Hentin Marz src/Kattis` +
Returns any problem from `Kattis` that's authored by `Hentin Marz`.

// end::find[]

// tag::findrule[]

==== Storing a problem-finding rule: `addfindrule`

Saves a problem-finding rule from provided constraints. +
Format: `addfindrule RULE_NAME [n/NAME] [a/AUTHOR] [d/DESCRIPTION] [src/SOURCE] [diff/LOWER_BOUND-UPPER_BOUND] [t/TAG]...` +
Alias: `afr`

[TIP]
The feature of storing/applying a problem-finding rule is complementary to the plan and tag feature: both tag and plan requires you to categorize problems one by one manually. If you simply want to "keep a list of problems" that fulfills certain conditions, say "algorithm questions of medium difficulty" or "graph theory questions from Kattis", you may store these rules using `addfindrule` and `apply` them later. Unlike plans, as you add new questions to AlgoBase, so long as the new questions fulfill the search rule, they will show up if you `apply` that rule.

[NOTE]
The rules for constraints are the same as those described in `find` command.

Examples:

* `addfindrule MediumDiffAlgo t/algorithm diff/2.0-4.0` +
Adds a new find rule named `MediumDiffAlgo` that when applied, returns any problem with `algorithm` as one of its tags AND with a difficulty between 2.0 and 4.0 (inclusive).
* `addfindrule Kattis src/Kattis` or `afr Kattis src/Kattis` +
Adds a new find rule named `Kattis` that when applied, returns any problem from `Kattis`.

==== Applying a problem-finding rule: `apply`

Applies a problem-finding rule. +
Format: `apply INDEX`

* Applies the find rule at the specified `INDEX`.
* The index refers to the index number shown in the displayed find rule list.
* The index *must be a positive integer* 1, 2, 3, ...

[TIP]
You can find problem-finding rules that you can `apply` with in the "Find Rules" panel by clicking on the "Find Rules" tab.

image::apply_tip_find_rule_tab.png[]

[NOTE]
`apply` a problem-finding rule is essentially the same as executing a pre-filled `findprob` command.

Examples:

* `apply 2` +
Applies the 2nd find rule in the displayed list.

==== Deleting a problem-finding rule: `deletefindrule`

Deletes a problem-finding rule. +
Format: `deletefindrule INDEX` +
Alias: `dfr`

* Deletes the find rule at the specified `INDEX`.
* The index refers to the index number shown in the displayed find rule list.
* The index *must be a positive integer* 1, 2, 3, ...

Examples:

* `deletefindrule 2` or `dfr 2` +
Deletes the 2nd find rule in the displayed list.

// end::findrule[]

* Plans cannot have duplicate names.
* `START_DATE` and `END_DATE` should be in the format of `yyyy-MM-dd`
* `START_DATE` should be before or equal to `END_DATE`.
* `START_DATE` will be `LocalDate#now()` if not specified, and `END_DATE` will be one month from `START_DATE` if not specified.

Examples:

* `addplan n/CS2040 d/past year questions in practical exams start/2019-01-01 end/3019-12-12`

==== Deleting a plan : `deleteplan`

Deletes an existing plan. +
Format: `deleteplan INDEX`

* Deletes the plan at the specified `INDEX`.
* The index refers to the index number shown in the displayed plan list.
* The index *must be a positive integer* 1, 2, 3, ...

=== Tabs

image::gui/TabsOverview.png[width="70%"]
_fig 3.7.0 – Types of Tabs highlighted in Orange_

There are 2 types of tabs in AlgoBase: Display and Details tabs.

* **Display tabs** give a high level overview of the contents of a list of items
(e.g. a list of `problems`/`tags`/`plans`).
* **Details tabs** give a more detailed description of an item in a display tab.

In the example in fig 3.7.0, there is a problem called "Sequences" in the current display tab.
The details for this problem can be seen in the details tab where the orange arrow is pointing to.

==== Switching Tabs: `switchtab`
