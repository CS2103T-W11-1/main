== Introduction

AlgoBase (AB) is for those who prefer to use a desktop app for managing algorithm problems. AlgoBase can let you establish and modify your own training plan for algorithm problems flexibly and it can save several training plans at the same time on your local storage!  Also, you can use diverse tags and search to manage your questions and training plans conveniently. More importantly, AlgoBase is optimized for those who prefer to work with a Command Line Interface (CLI) while still having the benefits of a Graphical User Interface (GUI). If you can type fast, ALgoBase can get your problem management tasks done faster than traditional GUI apps. Interested? Jump to the Section 2, “Quick Start” to get started. Enjoy! :-))

== Quick Start

.  Ensure you have Java `11` or above installed in your Computer.
.  Download the latest `algobase.jar` link:{repoURL}/releases[here].
.  Copy the file to the folder you want to use as the home folder for your AlgoBase application.
.  Double-click the file to start the app. The GUI should appear in a few seconds.

+
.  Type the command in the command box and press kbd:[Enter] to execute it. +
e.g. typing *`help`* and pressing kbd:[Enter] will open the help window.
.  Some example commands you can try:

* *`list`* : lists all problems
* **`add`**`n/factorial d/define a function factorial that takes in a number and n and returns the factorial of the number t/recursion a/Halim` : adds a problem called 'factorial' tagged with 'recursion' and authored by 'Wee Han'
* *`exit`* : exits the app

.  Refer to <<Features>> for details of each command.

[[Features]]
== Features

====
*Command Format*

* Words in `UPPER_CASE` are the parameters to be supplied by the user e.g. in `add n/NAME`, `NAME` is a parameter which can be used as `add n/John Doe`.
* Items in square brackets are optional e.g `n/NAME [t/TAG]` can be used as `n/factorial t/recursion` or as `n/factorial`.
* Items with `…`​ after them can be used multiple times including zero times e.g. `[t/TAG]...` can be used as `{nbsp}` (i.e. 0 times), `t/recursion`, `t/recursion t/dynamic-programming` etc.
* Parameters can be in any order e.g. if the command specifies `n/NAME a/AUTHOR`, `a/AUTHOR n/NAME` is also acceptable.
====

=== Problems

==== Adding a problem: `add`

Generates a new problem. +
Format: `add n/NAME [a/AUTHOR] [w/WEBLINK] [d/DESCRIPTION] [diff/DIFFICULTY] [src/SOURCE] [t/TAG]...`

* `DIFFICULTY` should be an integer or decimal in the range of (0, 5] (left open right close range)

[TIP]
A problem can have any number of tags (including 0)

Examples:

* `add n/Sequences a/Tung Kam Chuen w/https://open.kattis.com/problems/sequences d/Find the sum of the number of inversions of the 2k sequences, modulo 1000000007 (109+7). diff/3.0 src/Kattis t/recursion`

==== Deleting a problem : `delete`

Deletes an existing problem. +
Format: `delete INDEX`

* Deletes the problem at the specified `INDEX`.
* The index refers to the index number shown in the displayed problem list.
* The index *must be a positive integer* 1, 2, 3, ...

Examples:

* `list` +
`delete 2` +
Deletes the 2nd problem in the displayed list.
* `find n/factorial` +
`delete 1` +
Deletes the 1st problem in the results of the `find` command.

==== Editing a problem : `edit`

Edits an existing problem. +
Format: `edit INDEX [d/DELETE] [n/NAME] [d/DESCRIPTION] [a/AUTHOR]  [t/TAG]...`

* Edits the problem at the specified `INDEX`. The index refers to the index number shown in the displayed problem list. The index *must be a positive integer* 1, 2, 3, ...
* At least one of the optional fields must be provided.
* Existing values will be updated to the input values.
* When editing tags, the existing tags of the problem will be removed i.e adding of tags is not cumulative.
* You can remove all the problem's tags by typing `t/` without specifying any tags after it.

Examples:

* `edit 1 a/John Doe +
Edits the author of the 1st problem to be `John Doe` respectively.
* `edit 2 n/permutations t/` +
Edits the name of the 2nd problem to be `permutations` and clears all existing tags.

==== Locating problems by name: `find`

Finds problems whose names contain any of the given keywords. +
Format: `find [n/NAME] [a/AUTHOR] [d/DESCRIPTION] [src/SOURCE] [diff/LOWER_BOUND-UPPER_BOUND] [t/TAG]...`

* Name
** is case-insensitive and is matched by words. e.g. `henz` will match `Henz`
** is matched word by word. e.g. `hello` will match `hello world` but not `helloworld`
** is considered a match as long as one word matches. e.g. `Henz Ben` matches both `Martin Henz` and `Ben Leong`
* Author requires an exact match.
* Description
** is case-insensitive
** is matched word by word
** is considered as a match only when the problem's description includes all words in the constraint. e.g. `wordA wordB` matches `wordC wordB wordA` not `wordD wordA`
* Source requires an exact match.
* Tag
** Constraints are separated by spaces. (e.g. `find t/Recursion Brute-Force` will display all problems with both tag `Recursion` and `Brute-Force`)
** Constraint tag set is a subset of matching problems. (e.g. `find t/Recursion Brute-Force` will match problem with tags `Recursion`+`Brute-Force`+`Playful` but not `Recursion`+`Adhoc`)
** Tags are considered equal only when the tag strings are exactly matched.
* Difficulty
** matches problems with `LOWER_BOUND <= difficulty <= UPPER_BOUND`
** Note that you should provide both bounds. If you want to match problems with exact difficulty `1.5`, please use `diff/1.5-1.5`

Examples:

* `find factorial` +
Returns `factorial` and `Factorialize`
* `find factorial permutations` +
Returns any problem having names `factorial`, or `permutations`

* String-based values (i.e. `name`, `author`, etc.) are sorted alphabetically.

Examples:

* `sort m/name`
Sorts the current list of problems in ascending order of names.
