== PROJECT: AlgoBase

---

== Overview

AlgoBase is a desktop address book application used for teaching Software Engineering principles. The user interacts with it using a CLI, and it has a GUI created with JavaFX. It is written in Java, and has about 10 kLoC.

== About this portfolio

This project portfolio details my individual contributions to the *AlgoBase* project. It includes a summary of the enhancements and other contributions I made throughout the duration  of the project. Additionally, portions of my contribution to the User Guide and Developer Guide have also been included.

== Summary of contributions

* *Major enhancement*: Implemented the problem searching and sorting feature.

** What it does: allows the user to filter problems by combining search constraints on most fields (e.g. problem names, sources, descriptions, difficulty, etc.), allows user to save and reuse some typical search rules and allows user to sort the search result.

** Justification: To organize algorithmic questions, the first step is to find a proper subset of AlgoBase to either add to a training plan or solve the problems directly. The search feature is one of the most frequently used functionality in *AlgoBase*.

** Highlights: This is a full-stack feature all the components of *AlgoBase* from `Logic` to `Model` to `Storage` to `UI`. It requires an in-depth analysis of the overall architecture of *AlgoBase* as the original implementation of `find` in AddressBook accepts only one search constraint (i.e. the name), but in *AlgoBase* we need to support combination of arbitrary (non-zero) number of search constraints.

* *Minor enhancement*: Implemented the `rewind` command to check command history.

** What it does: allows the user to navigate to previous commands using either `rewind INDEX` command or kbd:[Ctrl + ↑] keyboard shortcut.

** Justification: `rewind` is to make `addfindrule` more useful - the user can first check if their problem find rule is working as they expected by executing it using `find` command, then `rewind 1` or press kbd:[Ctrl + ↑] to restore the command text, change the command word to `addfindrule` and assign a name to the added find rule.
