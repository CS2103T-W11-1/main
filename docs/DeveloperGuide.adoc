== Setting up

Refer to the guide <<SettingUp#, here>>.

== Design

[[Design-Architecture]]
=== Architecture

.Architecture Diagram
image::ArchitectureDiagram.png[]

The *_Architecture Diagram_* given above explains the high-level design of the App. Given below is a quick overview of each component.

[TIP]
The `.puml` files used to create diagrams in this document can be found in the link:{repoURL}/docs/diagrams/[diagrams] folder.
Refer to the <<UsingPlantUml#, Using PlantUML guide>> to learn how to create and edit diagrams.

`Main` has two classes called link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/Main.java[`Main`] and link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/MainApp.java[`MainApp`]. It is responsible for,

* At app launch: Initializes the components in the correct sequence, and connects them up with each other.
* At shut down: Shuts down the components and invokes cleanup method where necessary.

<<Design-Commons,*`Commons`*>> represents a collection of classes used by multiple other components.
The following class plays an important role at the architecture level:

* `LogsCenter` : Used by many classes to write log messages to the App's log file.

The rest of the App consists of four components.

* <<Design-Ui,*`UI`*>>: The UI of the App.
* <<Design-Logic,*`Logic`*>>: The command executor.
* <<Design-Model,*`Model`*>>: Holds the data of the App in-memory.
* <<Design-Storage,*`Storage`*>>: Reads data from, and writes data to, the hard disk.

Each of the four components

* Defines its _API_ in an `interface` with the same name as the Component.
* Exposes its functionality using a `{Component Name}Manager` class.

For example, the `Logic` component (see the class diagram given below) defines it's API in the `Logic.java` interface and exposes its functionality using the `LogicManager.java` class.

==== How the architecture components interact with each other

The _Sequence Diagram_ below shows how the components interact with each other for the scenario where the user issues the command `delete 1`.

.Component interactions for `delete 1` command

The sections below give more details of each component.

[[Design-Ui]]
=== UI component

.Structure of the UI Component
image::UiClassDiagram.png[]

*API* : link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/algobase/ui/Ui.java[`Ui.java`]

The UI consists of a `MainWindow` that is made up of parts e.g.`CommandBox`, `ResultDisplay`, `PersonListPanel`, `StatusBarFooter` etc. All these, including the `MainWindow`, inherit from the abstract `UiPart` class.

The `UI` component uses JavaFx UI framework. The layout of these UI parts are defined in matching `.fxml` files that are in the `src/main/resources/view` folder. For example, the layout of the link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/MainWindow.java[`MainWindow`] is specified in link:{repoURL}/src/main/resources/view/MainWindow.fxml[`MainWindow.fxml`]

The `UI` component,

* Executes user commands using the `Logic` component.
* Listens for changes to `Model` data so that the UI can be updated with the modified data.

[[Design-Logic]]
=== Logic component

[[fig-LogicClassDiagram]]
.Structure of the Logic Component
image::LogicClassDiagram.png[]

*API* :
link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/algobase/logic/Logic.java[`Logic.java`]

.  `Logic` uses the `AlgoBaseParser` class to parse the user command.
.  This results in a `Command` object which is executed by the `LogicManager`.
.  The command execution can affect the `Model` (e.g. adding a problem).
.  The result of the command execution is encapsulated as a `CommandResult` object which is passed back to the `Ui`.
.  In addition, the `CommandResult` object can also instruct the `Ui` to perform certain actions, such as displaying help to the user.

Given below is the Sequence Diagram for interactions within the `Logic` component for the `execute("delete 1")` API call.

[[Design-Model]]
=== Model component

.Structure of the Model Component
image::ModelClassDiagram.png[]

*API* : link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/algobase/model/Model.java[`Model.java`]

The `Model`,

* stores a `UserPref` object that represents the user's preferences.
* stores the AlgoBase data.
* exposes unmodifiable `ObservableList<Problem>`, `ObservableList<Tag>`, `ObservableList<Plan>`, `ObservableList<Task>` that can be 'observed' e.g. the UI can be bound to this list so that the UI automatically updates when the data in the list change.
* does not depend on any of the other three components.

[[Design-Storage]]
=== Storage component

.Structure of the Storage Component
image::StorageClassDiagram.png[]

*API* : link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/algobase/storage/Storage.java[`Storage.java`]

The `Storage` component,

* can store `UserPref` objects in json format.
* can retrieve `UserPref` objects from json format.
* can store the AlgoBase app data including `Plan`, `Problem`, `Tag`, `Task` objects in relational manner in json format.
* can retrieve `Plan`, `Problem`, `Tag`, `Task` objects from json format.

[[Design-Commons]]
=== Common classes

Classes used by multiple components are in the `seedu.algobase.commons` package.

It contains utility files for configuration `ConfigUtil`, file handling `FileUtil`, ID generation `IdUtil`,
JSON storage `JsonUtil`, string manipulation `StringUtil` and others.

== Implementation

This section describes some noteworthy details on how certain features are implemented.

// tag::task[]

=== Task Management Feature

As a algorithmic problem management tool, one of the most important features will be manage tasks that have been done
and are to be done.

This section will describe in details the current implementation and design considerations of
the task management feature.

==== Current Implementation

The task management feature mainly involves four main behaviours:

* `AlgoBase#addTask()` - create a new task for a problem and add it to a specified plan.
* `AlgoBase#deleteTask()` - delete an existing task from a specified plan.
* `AlgoBase#doneTask()` - mark a task as done in a specified plan.
* `AlgoBase#undoneTask()` - mark a task as undone in a specified plan.

Given below is an example usage scenario and how the mechanism for adding tasks behaves at each step.

The following activity diagram summarizes what happens when a user executes the `AddTask` command:

image::task/AddTaskCommandActivityDiagram.png[]

_Figure 1. Activity Diagram for the Execution of `AddTask` Command_

Step 1. The user launches the application.

Step 2. AlgoBase displays a list of existing problems and plans in the UI.

Step 3. The user executes `addtask plan/1 prob/1` to add the problem with index 1 in the list to the plan with index 1.
The `AddTask` command calls `Plan#updateTasks` to create a new plan from the original plan with this additional task.
After that, `Model#setPlan()` is called to replace the original plan with the updated plan in the `PlanList`.

The following sequence diagram shows how the `addtask` operation works:

image::task/AddTaskSequenceDiagram.png[]

_Figure 2. Sequence Diagram for the Execution of `AddTask` Command_

==== Design Considerations

===== Aspect: Data structure to support the task commands.

* Alternative 1 (current choice): Use a `HashSet` in current AlgoBase to save all tasks in a plan.
** Pros: Users can manage the tasks conveniently.
** Cons: Harder to implement for relational storage.
* Alternative 2: Simply keep tasks as a part of a plan.
** Pros: No need to save the task separately in the storage, all tasks are under plans.
** Cons: Does not keep track of relations between tasks and plans.

=== Tag feature

==== Implementation
The tag mechanism is facilitated by UniqueTagList. It creates a list of Tag, stored internally as an uniqueTagList. Additionally, it implements the following operations:

* `AlgoBase#addTag()` - create a new tag in AlgoBase's uniqueTagList in the algobase history.
* `AlgoBase#deleteTag()` - delete a current tag which have already in the uniqueTagList.
* `AlgoBase#listTag()` - show the tags in the uniqueTagList in the algobase GUI for users
* `AlgoBase#editTag()` - edit the current tag which have already been in the uniqueTagList

These operations are exposed in the Model interface as `Model#addTag()`, `Model#deleteTag()`, `Model#listTag()` and `Model#editTag()` respectively.

Given below is an example usage scenario and how the tag mechanism behaves at each step.

Step1. The user launches the application for the first time. The UniqueTagList will be initialized with the initial algobase state

Step 2. The user executes `addtag t/easy` to add a tag named [easy] which have not applied in any problems. The addtag command calls Model#addtag(), causing the taglist added a tag after the ‘addtag t/easy’ command executes to be saved in the uniqueTagList.

The following sequence diagram shows how the `deletetag` operation works:

image::AddTagSequenceDiagram.png[]

Step 3. The user decides to execute the command `listtag` to show a tag list in the GUI of algobase. The `listtag` command calls Model#listtag(), causing the taglist shows the current components of uniqueTagList. Commands that do not modify the address book, such as `listtag`, will not call `Model#addTag()`, `Model#deleteTag()` or `Model#editTag()`. Thus the `uniqueTagList` remains unchanged.

Step 4.The user executes `edittag 1 t/hard` to edit the current tag [easy] to [hard] in the `uniqueTagList`. The `edittag 1 t/hard`
Command executes `edittag`, causing the taglist find the first tag in the list and change tag [easy] into [hard] and change all [easy] tag into [hard] in all problems.

Step 5. The user executes `deletetag t/hard` to delete the current tag [easy] in the uniqueTagList. The `deletetag t/hard` command executes `deletetag`, causing the taglist delete the [hard] tag in uniqueTagList and [hard] tag in all problems.
(diagram)

The following activity diagram summarizes what happens when a user executes a new tag modifying command

image::TagActivityDiagram.png[]

==== Design considerations

===== Aspect: Data structure to support the tag commands.

* Alternative 1 (current choice): Use a list in current AlgoBase to save the content of different tags which used in tagging different problems. While problems create new tags for problems, it will also add into tag-list in AlgoBase. While the tag in problems changes, the tag in tag-list will not change and add a new tag into the tag-list in AlgoBase. While modifying tag in tag-list will change the tag for all related problem.
** Pros: Users can manage the tags conveniently.
** Cons: May lead to many tags do not combine with problems.
* Alternative 2: Simply keep tags as a part of problems. While execute the tag command will search for all tags in problems for every times it execute.
** Pros: No need to save the tag separately in the storage, all tags are under problems.
** Cons: Difficult to manage tags in different problems. Waste time for computer to execute.

=== Find Problem Feature

Since AlgoBase is a management tool for algorithmic questions, the search functionality is crucial to the user’s experience with AlgoBase. For instance, the planning feature heavily relies on `find` command to determine the exact set of problems the user wants to include in a training plan.

This section will describe in detail the current implementation and design considerations of the find problem feature (i.e. search feature) of AlgoBase.

The following activity diagram summarizes what happens when a user executes the find command:

image::find/FindCommandActivityDiagram.png[]

_Figure 1. Activity Diagram for the Execution of `find` Command_

==== Current Implementation

The find problem feature mainly involves three parts:

1. validating and parsing user input
2. creating a filtering predicate from user’s search restrictions
3. update the displayed problem list with the filtering predicate.

The find problem feature is facilitated by the following classes:

* `FindProblemDescriptor`
+
It stores predicates that are needed to describe a `FindCommand`
+
Additionally, it implements the following operation(s):
+
** `FindProblemDescriptor#isAnyFieldProvided()` - Determines if there is at least one search restriction included in this instance of `FindProblemDescriptor`.
** `FindProblemDescriptor#equals(...)` - Two instances of `FindProblemDescriptor` are equal if and only if all of their predicates are equal.
* Predicates that implements interface `Predicate<Problem>`
+
These are classes that describes whether an instance of `Problem` is considered a match under a certain field with provided keyword(s).
+
** `NameContainsKeywordsPredicate`
*** It ignores case.
*** It returns true as long as one of the keywords appear in the name as a word. (“As a word” means the matching is done word by word. For instance, `hello` doesn’t match `helloworld`.)
** `AuthorMatchesKeywordPredicate`
*** It is case sensitive and matches the entire author string (i.e. requires an exact match).
** `DescriptionContainsKeywordsPredicate`
*** It ignores case.
*** It returns true only when all of the keywords appear in the description as a word.
** `SourceMatchesKeywordPredicate`
*** It requires an exact match.
** `DifficultyIsInRangePredicate`
*** It matches problems with LOWER_BOUND \<= difficulty \<= UPPER_BOUND
** `TagIncludesKeywordsPredicate`
*** Each keyword will be considered as a tag, and two tags are considered equal only when their names are exactly the same.
*** It returns true when the provided tags are a subset of the tags of the provided problem.
* `FindCommandParser`
It validates and parses user input to an instance of `FindCommand`.

[NOTE]
If the user provides difficulty range as one of the search restrictions, `FindCommandParser` expects the format `LOWER_BOUND \<= difficulty \<= UPPER_BOUND` while `LOWER_BOUND` and `UPPER_BOUND` are valid strings for doubles (i.e. parsable by `Double.parseDouble(...)`).

* `FindCommand`
+
It creates and stores the `predicate` from an instance of `FindProblemDescriptor`. `predicate` is used to perform the filtering of the displayed problem list when the command is executed.
+
`predicate` returns true only when the provided problem fulfills all restrictions described by the provided instance of `FindProblemDescriptor`.
+
Additionally, it implements the following operation(s):
+
** `FindCommand#execute(...)` - This method overrides `Command#execute(...)`. It filters problems in `filteredProblemList` in `model` with `predicate`.
** `FindCommand#equals(...)` - Two instances of `FindCommand` are equal if and only if their `predicate` are equal.

image::find/FindCommandClassDiagram.png[]

_Figure 2. Class Diagram of the Find Feature_

Given below is an example usage scenario and how the find problem mechanism behaves at each step.

Step 1. The user executes `find t/recursion diff/2.0-4.0` to find a problem with a tag “recursion” and difficulty between 2.0 and 4.0.

Step 2. `FindCommandParser` processes the user input and returns a `FindCommand` instance with the information of user’s search restrictions.

[NOTE]
If no valid search restriction is provided by the user, `FindCommandParser` will throw a parsing exception, which is handled and displayed to the user.

Step 3. `LogicManager` invokes `execute()` method of the returned `FindCommand`. `FindCommand` updates the problem list with user’s search restrictions.

image::find/FindCommandSequenceDiagram.png[]

_Figure 3. Sequence Diagram for the Execution of `find` Command_

==== Design Considerations

===== Aspect: How to update the displayed problem list in the UI

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Let UI display problems in a `FilteredList<Problem>` and update the displayed problem by calling `setPredicate` on the `FilteredList`.
** Pros: Provides good protection over unexpected changes on the displayed problem list.
** Cons: Need to write a complex logic to generate one predicate out of multiple search constraints.
* **Alternative 2:** Let UI displays problems in an `ObservableList<Problem>` and update the list directly.
** Pros: The implementation would be more straightforward as the logic can update the displayed list directly.
** Cons: Leaves room for potential unexpected changes on the displayed problem list as the observable list is open to any kind of operation.

===== Aspect: How to deal with the case where no search restriction is provided (i.e. user types in `find` with no arguments given)

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Treat it as an exception and notify the user to provide at least one constraint.
** Pros: Makes the meaning of `find` command clear - you can’t search for problems without giving any conditions.
** Cons: Has to check there is at least one predicate provided, making the implementation a bit more complicated.
* **Alternative 2:** Treat it as no restriction (i.e. `find` is equivalent to `list` in this case)
** Pros: Easier implementation (if all predicates are always-true predicates, using `.and` method to chain them together would naturally result in an always-true predicate).
** Cons: Confusing definition of a search function.

===== Aspect: How to make predicates optional (i.e. user doesn’t have to provide restrictions for all searchable fields)

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Use `FindProblemDescriptor` in which the getter for the predicate returns `Optional<Predicate>`.
** Pros: If the parser doesn’t receive keyword(s) for a specific field, it simply doesn’t call the descriptor’s setter for that field. It doesn’t need to deal with `null`, and `null` is dealt gracefully using `Optional.ofNullable(...)`
** Cons: Rather troublesome implementation of the descriptor.
* **Altermative 2:** Store predicates in `FindProblemCommand` and check for not-provided predicates by comparing it with `null`.
** Pros: More straightforward implementation.
** Cons: If we are to add more predicates, it’s more likely that we forget to check `null` value of the new predicate.

=== GUI Enhancements

An intuitive GUI facilitates the overall user friendliness of the application. The user should be able to navigate around the application easily to facilitate a smooth experience using AlgoBase. Additionally, multitasking is important as a user may be tackling multiple algorithmic questions at a single time. One of the main enhancements that we introduced to the GUI is tabbing, which fulfils these 2 requirements.

==== Current Implementation

The state of the GUI is stored in a `GuiState` object. The `GuiState` object contains a `TabManager` object, which manages tab information such as the tabs that are open and the tabs that are currently selected.

The information is linked to the `UI` through listeners. When the attributes of the `TabManager` object is updated, it triggers callback functions in the UI controllers that update the state of the UI displayed.

The following commands facilitate the management of tabs:

* `AlgoBase#switchTab()` - Switch between tabs within a specified Tab pane.
* `AlgoBase#openTab()` - Opens a new tab containing details of a model.
* `AlgoBase#closeTab()` - Closes an existing tab.

These operations are exposed in the `TabManager` class respectively as:

* `SwitchTab()`: `TabManager#setDisplayTabIndex` and `TabManager#setDetailsTabIndex`
* `OpenTab()`: `TabManager#addTab`
* `CloseTab()`: `TabManager#removeTab`

The following Activity Diagrams illustrate what happens when the user executes a `SwitchTabCommand` or `OpenTabCommand`

image::gui/SwitchTabCommandActivityDiagram.png[]
_Figure 1.1 Activity Diagram for the Execution of `switchtab` Command_

image::gui/OpenTabCommandActivityDiagram.png[]
_Figure 1.2 Activity Diagram for the Execution of `opentab` Command_

Given below is an example usage scenario and how the tag mechanism behaves at each step.

image::gui/SwitchTabsSequenceDiagram0.png[]
_Figure 2.1 Sequence Diagram for instantiating a `SwitchCommand` object_

Step 1: The user executes `switchtab t/display i/1` to switch to the first tab in the `display` tabpane.

Step 2: `SwitchTabCommandParser` processes the user input, retrieving the tab type (`display`) and the index (`1`).

Step 3: These two attributes are passed into the constructor of a `SwitchTabCommand` and a corresponding `SwitchTabCommand` object is returned to the LogicManager


image::gui/SwitchTabsSequenceDiagram1.png[]
_Figure 2.2 Sequence Diagram for updating the tab index in the TabManager_

Step 4: `LogicManager` invokes `execute()` method of the returned `SwitchTabCommand`, which retrieves the TabManager from the `Model` object. The `setDisplayTabPaneIndex(1)` method is invoked with the index 1 that the `SwitchTabCommand` was instantiated with.

Step 5: Invoking this method updates the integer value in the `displayTabIndex` field (type `ObservableIntegerValue`) of the `TabManager`.


image::gui/SwitchTabsSequenceDiagram2.png[]
_Figure 3.3 Sequence Diagram for reflecting the tab changes_

Step 6: A listener was added to the `displayTabIndex` field when the application was initialized. When a change in the value is detected, it triggers the `selectTab(1)` method with the value of the new index passed as an argument. This updates the selected tab in the UI.

==== Design Considerations

Aspect: Implementation of Tab Logic

* Alternative 1 (current choice): Implement Tab Logic separately within model and UI.
** Pros: Modularizes the logic and reduces the need for tighter coupling between model and UI
** Cons: Multiple sources of truth and more modules to be implemented
* Alternative 2: Implement Tab Logic as a singular module
** Pros: Single source of truth for state of tabs
** Cons: Increasing coupling between Model and UI, which in turn reduces testability

Aspect: How to update the tab in the UI

* Alternative 1 (current choice): Using a listener to detect changes to state of tab
** Pros: Reduces coupling between the `TabManager` class and the UI
** Cons: As callback functions are utilized, it is not immediately obvious how changes in state of TabManager leads to a change in the UI
* Alternative 2:
** Pros: Execution is sequential and it is easier to keep track of the flow of the program.
** Cons: Increases coupling between the `TabManager` class and the UI and reduces testability.

== Instructions for Manual Testing

Given below are instructions to test the app manually.

[NOTE]
These instructions only provide a starting point for testers to work on; testers are expected to do more _exploratory_ testing.

=== Launch and Shutdown

. Initial launch

.. Download the jar file and copy into an empty folder
.. Double-click the jar file +
   Expected: Shows the GUI with a set of sample problems. The window size may not be optimum.

. Saving window preferences

.. Resize the window to an optimum size. Move the window to a different location. Close the window.
.. Re-launch the app by double-clicking the jar file. +
   Expected: The most recent window size and location is retained.

=== Deleting Problems

. Deleting a problem while all problems are listed

.. Prerequisites: List all problems using the `list` command. Multiple problems in the list.
.. Test case: `delete 1` +
   Expected: First problem is deleted from the list. Details of the deleted problem shown in the status message. Timestamp in the status bar is updated.
.. Test case: `delete 0` +
   Expected: No problem is deleted. Error details shown in the status message. Status bar remains the same.
.. Other incorrect delete commands to try: `delete`, `delete x` (where x is larger than the list size) +
   Expected: Similar to previous.

=== Saving Data

. Dealing with missing/corrupted data files

.. Delete the `data` folder in project root folder and launch AlgoBase. +
   Expected: No errors shown. A new data file is created silently.

.. Delete some mandatory fields in the data file located at `data/algobase.json` and launch AlgoBase. +
   Expected: Error details shown in the status message, indicating corrupted data file.
